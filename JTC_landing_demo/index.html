        <h2>Your cloud, your journey</h2>
        <h3>Your guide to the why, what and how of evolving with the cloud. <br/>Or not...</h3>
        <h4>The cloud is not a destination.</h4>
        <p>Let's clear up something right here at the beginning of your journey. Your journey to the cloud is not <em>one</em> journey, but many.</p>
        <p>That is because the cloud is not a singular destination, contrary to the narrative of many cloud discussions in the market. It is common to make the cloud sound as if it is a place where you arrive. As though you are at A, the cloud is B, and all you need to do is get from A to B.</p>
        <p>But the cloud is not your destination, is it? The cloud is simply a part of your mission-critical business. You must adapt to and straddle different IT deployments in ways that make sense for your business. One of those is the cloud, and an initial move to a cloud platform is just the first step. As you optimize your IT environment, the cloud will continue to evolve.</p>
        <p>But even though the cloud is not your destination, you are still on a journey. Maybe you call it your digital transformation journey. Or your hybrid IT journey. What matters is that your organization’s transformation is catalysed by the cloud. Your workloads and apps move at different times, to different endpoints or cloud platforms.</p>
        <p>Your cloud journey is multiple journeys, with multiple destinations. And as technologies evolve, new destinations become available, empowering your business to evolve. Some of your journeys will end. Other journeys will start.</p>

      <h2>On your journey to the cloud,<br/>you need a guide.</h2>
      <div class="float">
        <p>The one companion who is along for the journey, regardless of the journey you are on, is your data. Your data needs to be accessible, able to move between applications and locations on different platforms, efficiently. It must remain secure at all times, whether at rest or in transit.</p>
        <p>So how do you navigate this cloud journey? How do you decide if your data stays on-premise or moves to colocation, if it gets hosted in a private cloud or in a hyperscale cloud? You navigate with the help of a partner — someone who guides you on your journey to many destinations. Someone who helps your business connect and secure your hybrid environment.</p>
        <p>Remember, the cloud is not an "out of the box" option. Your situation is unique and requires careful planning and analysis. It requires a partner who has your back and who ensures you are positioned for success.</p>

      <h2>The cloud advantage</h2>
      <h3>Why you should start a cloud journey</h3>
      <p>Cloud has emerged as a platform that can unshackle IT from the manual efforts, processes and procedures of traditional legacy environments. It does this by creating highly secure, highly automated and highly agile hybrid environments designed for IT ease, management and accountability.</p>
      <p>If your organization is just starting your cloud journey, the incentive is likely your need for greater agility and efficiency. And you need to enhance your ability to adapt quickly to changing conditions, and scale up (or down) at a moment’s notice.</p>
      <p>Cloud computing has a number of benefits. If architected and deployed the right way with the right partner, cloud gives you greater flexibility, agility and control of your IT. It is typically more cost-effective, and is often used in a hybrid solution with hosted, collocated and traditional on-premises IT infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>Which Cloud?</h2>
      <h3>Consider these factors when evaluating your cloud options</h3>
      <p>Many organizations think their journey is simply deploying servers and virtual machines into a cloud — whether it is Azure, AWS or their own private cloud. But the cloud is a lot more complex than just spinning up a virtual machine. The cloud journey simply begins there.</p>
      <h4>Digital transformation</h4>
      <p>AAccording to industry research firm IDC, digital transformation will soon reach macroeconomic scales. By 2021, at least 50 percent of the global GDP will be digitized, with growth in every industry driven by digitally enhanced offerings, operations and relationships.</p>
      <p>Collaboration and access to information is key. Brainstorming a new idea or business concept — then testing it and rolling it out in weeks, days or even hours — is the pace that business innovation is occurring at today. Cloud is the enabler of this new speed of innovation.</p>
      <h4>Evaluating your cloud options</h4>
      <p>If your business is typical, you likely will not migrate everything to the cloud, and certainly not in one move. You will keep some of your compute, storage and network resources on-premises and host some of them in the cloud in a hybrid IT environment. The cloud is an evolution — workloads move and are optimised. Again, it is not simply a case of moving from A to B.</p>
      <p>Hybrid IT environments feature two or more of the following infrastructure options:</p>
      <section class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/CP1_Icon_Value_Prop_RGB_SAVINGS.jpg"/>
          <h2>On-premises / self-managed</h2>
          <p>This is the traditional deployment model in which end users employ an IT department to manage IT assets — hardware and software — owned by the company. With the exception of firms born in the cloud, virtually 100 percent of businesses use this deployment model.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/CP1_Icon_Value_Prop_RGB_NETWORK_OPS_CENTRE.jpg"/>
          <h2>Colocation</h2>
          <p>The practice of using a third-party data center for the housing of servers and other IT devices is called colocation. End users retain ownership of the servers but use the building, connectivity, power and security services of specialized providers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/CP1_Icon_Value_Prop_RGB_BENEFITS.jpg"/>
          <h2>Hosting</h2>
          <p>In this deployment model, vendors not only provide the data center facility, security, power and cooling, but also the servers and required storage. This allows for a high degree of customization and control, with predicatable costs. It also provides access to managed services to look after your infrastructure, network, operating systems, hypervisors and databases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/CP1_Icon_Value_Prop_RGB_GROWTH.jpg"/>
          <h2>Cloud</h2>
          <p>Cloud is about leveraging the power of network and IT assets to their maximum effect. This potential brings complexity with it. Whether it is private cloud (on-premises or hosted in a data center), public or hyperscale – important decisions will need to be made around IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. There are many paths in the cloud, and unmitigated complexity can impede decision-making.</p>
        </div>        
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/CP1_Icon_Value_Prop_RGB_CUSTOMER_INSPIRED.jpg"/>
          <h2>Connectivity</h2>
          <p>Network connectivity must be a pillar of a hybrid solution. The ability to move data efficiently and securely across a hybrid environment and achieve the low latencies necessary to unlock the full potential of cloud is vital. Having this holistic view of a hybrid environment that includes connectivity will enable cloud investments to be optimised and should be a view shared by you cloud partner.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <div class="testimonial">“It starts with attempting to solve a business problem, then evaluating the options. Cloud may not always be the right option. Whether that is the case or not, a holistic approach to solution architecture that encompasses the platform choice, security and connectivity is the best way to ensure business outcomes are met — and ROI is proven.” — Jason Vigus, Cogeco Peer 1 Product Manager, Managed & Professional Services</div>
      <h3>The value of taking a guide along on your journey</h3>
      <p>On your cloud journey, you will likely need a guide to complement your existing IT staff with professional IT services. A good partner helps you manage your journey to the cloud by helping you make sense of complex hosting environments and connectivity deployments.</p>
      <p>A partner also helps you prepare for and then migrate applications and data from on-premises to public, private or hybrid cloud. A partner can assess options and help you determine the right platforms for each workload – cloud or otherwise. They can architect, design and build a solution including connectivity and security in these phases.</p>
      <p>Further, your cloud partner can provide expert project management and be able to plan and execute the migration of data and application to a new environment, then be able to handle the ongoing management once it is live.</p>
      <p>In essence, a partner on your journey to the cloud extends the power of your technical teams with deep expertise in technologies and processes that help you achieve strategic business outcomes.</p>
      <p>Some partners can help you at the consulting end of things, some can help you at the hardware and software end, and some can help throughout your journey, no matter where your destination happens to be. A partner such as Cogeco Peer 1, for example, can help you with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Managed IT services</li>
        <li>Assessment, design, build, migration and project management</li>
        <li>Managed cloud</li>
        <li>Colocation</li>
        <li>Connectivity</li>
        <li>IT security & compliance</li>
      </ul>
